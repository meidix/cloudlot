# CloudLot

CloudLot is a sophisticated cloud resource management and scheduling system designed for efficient allocation and management of computing resources in cloud environments. It provides a robust framework for handling CPU and memory resources, task scheduling, and serverless function execution.

## Features

### Resource Management
- Dynamic CPU and memory resource allocation
- Support for multiple CPU cores
- Memory capacity management
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Over-provisioning capabilities
- Resource starvation handling

### Task Management
- Task scheduling and execution
- Task-to-resource mapping
- CPU power redistribution
- Memory allocation tracking

### Serverless Components
- Serverless function execution
- Request handling
- Task scheduling
- Client management

## Core Components

### ResourceProvisioner
The main class responsible for managing and allocating resources. It handles:
- CPU and memory resource allocation
- Task scheduling
- Resource utilization tracking
- Over-provisioning management

### Resource Management
- `Resource`: Base class for resource management
- `ProcessingResource`: CPU resource management
- `MemoryResource`: Memory resource management

### Task Management
- Task allocation and deallocation
- Resource mapping
- Execution tracking

## Serverless Components
The serverless package provides functionality for:
- Function invocation
- Request handling
- Task scheduling
- Client management
